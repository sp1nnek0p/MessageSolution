Congratulations! 

You have passed your first test and once we have reviewed all the submissions we will select the top candidates
to join us for a weekend workshop at our office.

Please send your CV and the code you used to solve this problem to pickme@soldersmith.com for us to look at.

At the workshop we will work through a typical problem from one of our clients and give you the opportunity to 
see what type of work we do and get a feel for the company culture.
